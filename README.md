AI.Diverge Chatbot is a cost-effective and adaptive chatbot solution designed to handle both simple and complex customer queries. It uses a lightweight, confidence-based routing approach—most user requests are answered by a cheaper, simpler model or rule-based system, while only low-confidence or high-complexity queries are routed to an advanced model (e.g., GPT-4).

Key Features
	1.	Confidence-Based Routing
	•	Quickly classifies or scores incoming queries; if the system is confident it can answer, it handles them locally. Otherwise, it forwards them to GPT-4.
	2.	Local Retrieval & FAQ Handling
	•	Uses a local (open-source) model, FAQ retrieval, or knowledge-base to handle typical e-commerce support topics.
	3.	GPT-4 Fallback
	•	In tough or ambiguous scenarios, the user query and context are sent to GPT-4, ensuring high-quality answers where needed without incurring high costs for every query.
	4.	Scalable
	•	Designed to run on minimal infrastructure for small e-commerce workloads. Can be scaled up with GPU instances or more advanced pipelines as traffic grows.
	5.	Modular & Extensible
	•	Built with a modular architecture so you can easily swap out or update the local model, the retrieval mechanism, or the fallback LLM.

               Final Answer to User

	1.	Classification/Confidence Check
	•	Uses an embedding-based or other scoring method to gauge if the query matches known FAQs or has a high probability of being answered locally.
	2.	Local System (Simple)
	•	If confidence is high (above threshold), it replies with a locally generated or rule-based FAQ answer.
	3.	GPT-4 (Fallback)
	•	If confidence is low (below threshold), the query gets forwarded to GPT-4 for a more advanced response.

Getting Started

1. Clone the Repo

git clone [https://github.com/your-org/ai.diverge-chatbot.git](https://github.com/noob-intern/ai.diverge-chatbot)
cd ai.diverge-chatbot

2. Set Up the Environment
	1.	Install Python Packages

pip install -r requirements.txt


	2.	Environment Variables
	•	GPT4_API_KEY: Your API key for GPT-4 (if using OpenAI).
	•	MODEL_PATH: Path to your local or open-source model (e.g., sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 or wherever your model is stored).
	•	THRESHOLD: Confidence score threshold (default 0.7).
Example .env file:

GPT4_API_KEY="sk-1234567890..."
MODEL_PATH="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
THRESHOLD="0.7"



3. Run the Chatbot Server

python app.py

	•	This will spin up a simple web server (e.g., Flask or FastAPI) on a local port (e.g., localhost:8000).
	•	You can then send POST requests to the chatbot endpoint or integrate with your front-end UI.

Usage
	1.	User Sends a Chat Message
	•	POST /chat, JSON payload:

{
  "query": "Where is my order?",
  "context": []
}


	2.	System Processing
	1.	Embedding or classification step checks if the query can be answered from an FAQ or local knowledge base.
	2.	If confidence >= THRESHOLD → use the local system's answer.
	3.	If confidence < THRESHOLD → escalate to GPT-4.
	3.	Response
	•	JSON payload:

{
  "answer": "Your order is in transit. Here's how to track it...",
  "source": "faq" 
  // or "gpt4" if it came from GPT-4
}

Customization
	•	Update Knowledge Base: You can add new FAQs to data/faqs.json (or your chosen knowledge storage) and re-index embeddings with scripts/index_faqs.py.
	•	Change Threshold: Increase or decrease the threshold in your .env file or config to control how often queries fallback to GPT-4.
	•	Swap Models: If you want to use LLaMA-2, GPT-Neo, or another open-source model locally, update the MODEL_PATH and install any required dependencies.

Roadmap
	•	Multi-Language Support: Expand embeddings and local model for multiple languages.
	•	Analytics Dashboard: Real-time logs to see how many queries are routed locally vs. GPT-4.
	•	Conversational Memory: Improve multi-turn conversation tracking.
	•	Fine-Tuning: Experiment with light fine-tuning on your domain-specific data for higher accuracy on local answers.
